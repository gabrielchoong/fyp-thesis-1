  abstract = {The automotive industry is facing a crucial time. The transformation from internal combustion engines to new electrical technologies requires enormous investment, and hence the IC engines are likely to serve as a means of transportation for the coming decades. The search for sustainable green alternative fuel and operating parameter optimization is a current feasible solution and is a critical issue among the scientific community. Engine experiments are complicated, costly, and time-consuming, especially when the global economy is drastically down due to the COVID-19 pandemic and putting the limitation of social distancing. Industries are looking for proven computational solutions to address these issues. Recently, artificial neural network has been proven beneficial in several areas of engineering to reduce the time and experimentation cost. The IC engine is one of them. ANN has been used to predict and analyze different characteristics such as performance, combustion, and emissions of the IC engine to save time and energy. The complex nature of ANN may lead to computation time, energy, and space. Recent studies are centered on changing the network topology, deep learning, and design of ANN to get the highest performance. The present study summarizes the application of ANN to predict and optimize the complicated characteristics of various types of engines with different fuels. The study aims to investigate the network topologies adopted to design the model and thereafter statistical evaluation of the developed ANN models. A comparison of the ANN model with other prediction models is also presented.}

  abstract = {This paper reviews the artificial intelligent algorithms in engine management. This study provides a clear image of the current state of affairs for the past 15 years and provides fresh insights and improvements for future directions in the field of engine management. The scope of this paper comprises three main aspects to be discussed, namely, engine performance, engine control, and engine diagnosis. The first is associated with the need to control the basic characteristics that prove that the engine is working properly, namely, emission control and fuel economy. Engine control refers to the ability to identify and fulfill the requirements derived from performance, emissions, and durability. In this part, hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) application and transient operations are discussed. Lastly, engine diagnosis entails assessment techniques that can be used to identify problems in the engine and solve them accordingly. In this part, misfire detection, knock detection, and intake system leakage will be evaluated. In engine performance, neural network algorithms provide efficient results in terms of emission control and fuel economy as the requirements are easily achievable. However, when it comes to engine control and diagnosis, the fuzzy logic rule with its strong robustness and neural networks algorithms are limited in efficiency due to the complex nature of the processes and the presence of big data, for instance, in HEVs in engine control. That has brought forward the usage of reinforcement learning and novel machine learning algorithms in recent years to maximize efficiency in engine control and engine diagnosis, as highlighted in the following part. The PRISMA methodology was used to justify the reference selection in this review.},

  abstract = {The human kind is facing various natural calamities such as Elnino, forest fires, climate change, etc., due to environmental degradation and pollution. The United Nations has come with sustainable development goals in order to protect the environment and life on earth. The major contributors for degradation of environment are power plants and transport sectors. Usage of IC engines for transportation and power generation is inevitable as IC engine technologies are matured and standardised. However, to meet the sustainable development goals of United Nations, the performance has to be improved and the emissions should be near zero to meet the stringent pollution norms. Various performance parameters of IC engines such as brake power, brake-specific fuel consumption, and brake thermal efficiency are to be improved for various engine operating conditions. Similarly, the emissions such as hydrocarbon, NOx, oxides of carbon, etc. are to be reduced. The ideal operating condition with increased performance and to reduced emission is difficult to achieve. Machine learning is a tool which is used to predict the best operating condition for augmented performance and reduced emissions. In this review article, exhaustive reviews of different machine learning techniques used by different authors are discussed in detailed with reference to performance and emission parameters of IC engines. The widely used machine learning algorithms for prediction of IC engine performance and emission are artificial neural networks, relevance vector method, support vector machine, genetic algorithm, response surface method, and gene expression programming.},

  abstract = {Biodiesel has been emerging as a potential and promising biofuel for the strategy of reducing toxic emissions and improving engine performance. Computational methods aiming to offer numerical solutions were inevitable as a study methodology which was sometimes considered the only practical method. Artificial neural networks (ANN) were data-processing systems, which were used to tackle many issues in engineering and science, especially in some fields where there was a failure of the conventional modeling approaches. Thus, it was believed that the best choice was the development of a novel approach like the ANN model to anticipate engine performance and exhaust emissions with high accuracy. In this review paper, the structure and applicability of the ANN model were comprehensively evaluated. More importantly, the use of ANN with trained, tested, and validated data was introduced to determine the performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fueled with biodiesel-based fuel. In general, the ANN model could supply a relatively high determination coefficient as compared between predicted results and experimental data, showing that the ANN model could have a good ability to predict the engine behaviors with an accuracy higher than 95\%.},
